# haxeui-heaps — agent guide

Independent fork of `haxeui/haxeui-heaps` (Heaps backend of HaxeUI). Its consumers pin it by commit; they do not dictate how it is worked on. This file is the source of truth here.

## Commits
- Every commit is **code** (library sources under `haxe/`, upstream metadata, tests) or **infrastructure** (the paths listed in `.github/infra-paths`: this file, `openspec/`, our CI and scripts). Never both — CI rejects a mixed commit.
- OpenSpec artifacts (proposal, tasks, specs, archive) are infrastructure commits and never share a commit with code.
- Code commit messages are written as for upstream: `area(scope): imperative summary`, no mention of consumers or their paths.
- An upstream PR is a cherry-pick of one task's code commits; keep them self-contained.
- Changing the list of infrastructure paths is an infrastructure commit.

## Checks
- `bash .github/scripts/check-commit-kinds-test.sh` — self-test of the commit-kind check.
- `bash .github/scripts/check-commit-kinds.sh origin/master..HEAD` — run it on your branch before pushing.
- Build: `HAXE_STD_PATH=.haxe/std .haxe/haxe .serena/lsp.hxml --no-output` must exit 0 (`tools/setup.sh` ends with it, and so does the `build` job of CI) — every module of `haxe/`, typed for HashLink against the pinned libraries (see *Toolchain*). The library has no test suite of its own yet.

## Toolchain
Run `tools/setup.sh` once in every checkout or worktree, before anything else. It is the only setup step.
- **Compiler.** Build, type and run tests only with the pinned Haxe 5: `.haxe/haxe` with `HAXE_STD_PATH=.haxe/std`. Never the system `haxe` (4.x). The pin is `tools/haxe-build.pin` — one line, `<build key> <sha256 of the archive>`, a build of `GeTechG/haxe`; changing the compiler is a one-commit change to that file.
- **Libraries.** `tools/libs.pin` pins the sources of `haxeui-core`, `heaps`, `format` and `hlsdl` by commit. They are fetched outside the checkout; `.serena/lsp.hxml` lists their classpaths.
- **Serena** (symbol navigation, configured in `.mcp.json` and `.codex/config.toml`) uses the language server and the display config `.serena/lsp.hxml` the script generates. Re-run the script after adding or removing source files or changing a pin, then restart Serena.
- **Reference lists are not exhaustive.** The language server can miss call sites, and misses more when a module of `.serena/lsp.hxml` does not compile (the script fails loudly then). A lookup can also fail outright with a compiler error from library code, typically for a member with a common name (`get`, `set`). Before a rename or a removal, check against a text search (`grep -rn`).
- **ast-grep** (`.ast-grep/ast-grep`, configured by `sgconfig.yml`; version and grammar commit — `GeTechG/tree-sitter-haxe` — are pinned in `tools/setup.sh`) finds Haxe code by syntactic shape: `.ast-grep/ast-grep run -p 'new $T($$$A)' -l haxe haxe`. Run it from the repository root.
- **Which search.** *ast-grep* — where code of a given shape occurs (it skips comments and strings), and a bulk edit by pattern: `--rewrite '…'`, read the diff it prints, then apply with `-U`. *Serena* — what a name means: declaration, references, implementations, a rename. *Text search* (`grep -rn`) — comments, strings, non-Haxe files, and the cross-check of the other two. A pattern has to parse as a Haxe fragment on its own; when one finds nothing where text search does, look at it with `--debug-query=ast` and match by node kind instead (`--kind EThrow`). Grammar bugs are filed in the TSHX project.
- **Lookup order.** Serena → `ast-grep` → text search, the first that answers. Read a file directly only once one of them has located the spot, and then only the range you need — never a whole source file to see what is in it (the symbol overview of Serena answers that).

## Specs
`openspec/` holds this fork's own specs (`openspec/specs/`). Behaviour or rule changes go through `openspec/changes/`.

## Workflow
No pull requests: this fork is worked on solo. Work lives on branches and lands on `master` by rebase or merge; the only mandatory gate is green checks (see *Checks*) on the exact tree that lands. Work is scheduled by baton — load the `/baton` skill before filing or picking up an issue, or changing an issue's status, labels, `footprint` or blockers.

An issue runs the same seven steps, in order:

1. **OpenSpec change.** Branch `change/<ISSUE-KEY>-<openspec-name>` from `origin/master` — one task, one branch — and write the change under `openspec/changes/`. Skip the OpenSpec change — here and in step 3 — when the work is mechanical, i.e. nothing the project history needs a record of (docs, renames, config, a bug fix that returns behaviour to what a spec already states). Anything else that touches behaviour is not mechanical — the change is mandatory. A missing spec is never a reason to skip: when `openspec/specs/` does not yet cover the behaviour the task touches, the change adds that spec as a new capability, so the next task has it to work against. A skip is never silent: the report on the issue carries the line `OpenSpec skipped: <reason>`. The other steps stay. An issue labeled `gate:spec` stops here: push the artifacts, post a short plan on the issue, add `needs-human`; continue once the maintainer swaps it for `spec:approved`.
2. **Implement** the tasks.
3. **Test.** Verify the implementation against the change, then sync its specs and archive it as the **last commit of the branch** (never a separate push to `master`), rebase onto current `master` and run the checks. Unless the task is trivial (mechanical, or a few obvious lines), finish with a cross-review of the whole branch diff before the checks — `/ai-brainstorm:ai-review`, a judge from another model family — and fix or rebut its findings until clean.
4. **Human QA — only if the change has it.** Steps only a human can do are written `- [ ] N.M [human] …` in `tasks.md`; agents never tick them. If there are any, post them on the issue as a checklist a human can follow cold, add `needs-human` and stop; continue once the maintainer removes the label. No `[human]` tasks → skip.
5. **Merge** into `master`: `git merge --ff-only` for a single commit or a short linear series, `git merge --no-ff` for a multi-commit change. Push `master`. If `master` moved since the checks ran, rebase and run them again first.
6. **Clean up**: delete the branch (local and remote) and its worktree.
7. **Set the issue done.**

The maintainer decides architecture and end-user behaviour, nothing else — steps 1 (`gate:spec`) and 4 are the only points where an agent waits for a human. Work without an issue: mechanical edits may go straight to `master`.
